APPENETX 1. WAR DIARY. NO.10_ CANADIAN STATIONARY HOSPITAL.
EVENTS LEADING TO FORMATION OF UNIT.

Western University of London, Ontario, between September,1914 and March,1916,
made several offérs to the Canadian Government to organize a complete Hospital Unit for Overseas
Service. To these offérs the Canadian Government replied that the War Office deemed they had
at the time sufficient Units of that nature.

It was considered by the Board of Governors that Western University was in a peculiarly
advantageous position to supply a Hospital unit. A large number of its students in Medicine
and other branches were anxious to enlist; many of ite graduates, practising physicians and
surgeons, had expressed their willingness to proceed Overseas as Medical Officers, and a number
of graduate Nurses of London Hospitals, who were associated with the University, desired to
serve as Nursing Sisters. The buildings and grounds df the University were avaibable as a
training centre during the Summer months. It was anticipated that the proposed Unit could be
very rapidly recruited and trained ready for Overseas.

Accordingly further urgent representations were made to ottawa in March 1916, with the
result that authority was received to mobilize the Western University Hospital, officially known
No.10 Stationary Hospital ,C.5,Fe s

Edwin Seaborn,M.D.;°8 graduate of the University and long associated with its
School of Medicine »d Surgery, was nominated by the Board of Governors as Officer Commanding
the Unit, and in due course the appointment was approved by Militia Headquarters, Ottawa.
